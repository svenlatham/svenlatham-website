<h1>Sven Latham</h1>

<p>I am a researcher, strategist and advisor with many years' experience working with senior managers at
    companies large and small, across multiple industries and countries.</p>



<p>My expertise are in software systems, automation &amp; data in the domains of town centre management and
    government at various levels &#8211; although my travels have led me into all sorts of weird &amp; wonderful
    sectors as well.</p>

<p>I run <a href="https://www.noggin.bi">Noggin</a>, using data to analyse the effects of events &amp; changes on
    the high street.</p>



<p>I am also a Partner and CTO at <a href="https://www.ethosvo.org/">Ethos VO</a>, a group of social entrepreneurs
    encouraging positive change. I work on the Smart Cities project, where we&#8217;re pioneering ideas to improve
    air quality, retail &amp; economic conditions of our High Streets.</p>



<p>In my spare time, I enjoy travelling, map collecting and studying languages. I&#8217;m partial to a <a
        href="/beer/">good Belgian
        beer</a>. My ideal holiday is on a canal boat in the Midlands with a delicious evening pub meal to look forward
    to.
</p>



<p>I can speak for hours on data, security, technology, knowledge management and other subjects close to my heart.
    Thankfully I can also condense it into presentations, talks, articles or a private chat over coffee (black, no
    sugar).</p>
