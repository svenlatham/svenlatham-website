<h1>üç∫ Beer</h1>

<p>I do enjoy a fine Belgian beer. Here's my ongoing list...</p>

<p>Of course, my notes aren't as detailed as Untappd. I'm no <em>zythologist</em>, so these act more as an aide for exploration than detailed notes!</p>

<ul>
<li>Westmalle - gorgeous triple brewed golden strong pale ale.</li>
<li>Achel - like Westmalle, triple brewed (I think), strong and dark taste.</li>
<li>La Trappe Quadrupel - is very nice, strong, lovely smooth taste. Errs towards caramel/chocolate levels of taste.</li>
<li>Rochefort 8 very nice dark beer. Strong.</li>
<li>rochefort 10 Dark again, stronger.</li>
<li>Westvleteren - very difficult to get hold of (you shouldn't see this for resale - it's supposed to be bought direct from the abbey). Refined, strong, The 8 degrees bottle is a nice, strong dark taste but surprisingly not too fizzy. Hints of chocolate aftertaste. Nice all rounder but it's not "amazing" as the exclusivity might suggest! 10 is pretty well as expected, a darker, stronger beer with a tiny bit more fizz.</li>
<li>tripel karmeliet lovely; triple beer so very strong taste, halfway between dark and blond</li>
<li>Gouden Karolus - I do like this (can't remember why - may be a good sign...)</li>
<li>Brugse Zot - quite nice! A bit clich√©ed - more popular than it is tasty.</li>
<li>If you like Zot, try Orval, La Mointoise, some of the Leffe varieties (Blond, Bruin), La Trappe might be a possibility as well.</li>
<li>Chimay (dark) and Orval (amber) also very nice - two more Trappist beers.</li>
<li>Chimay Grand Reserve 2019 - Dark, almost chocolate taste. Strong, deep and pleasant.</li>
<li>Chimay Cinq Cents - Much blonder beer with a slight fermentation/vinegar taste. Not fantastic.</li>
<li>La chouffe - Unfiltered blond beer, Really nice aftertaste a bit like the better Leffe blond. quite strong.</li>
<li>La Chouffe (blue) - quite a caramel, dark taste. Perhaps a bit overpowering. Not my favourite.</li>
<li>Duvel - distinctive, lighter beer. A bit too fizzy in 75cl variants.</li>
<li>Texels Springtij - (Dutch beer) good but not fantastic. nice enough, quite bubbly but nice caramel aftertaste</li>
<li>Palm - soft and sweet beer.</li>
<li>La Mointoise - Blond beer, quite fizzy. One of the weaker beers - good for a sunny evening.</li>
<li>St Bernadus - nice beer, easy to drink, not so sweet.</li>
<li>St Feuillen - slightly fizzy blond beer, strong-ish (7.5%) but nice and easy to drink.</li>
<li>Orval ... slightly sour taste but still delicious, slightly creme and caramel flavour. not too fizzy. cloudy and light brown.</li>
<li>Kwak ever so slightly sour taste, strong beer (8.5%) with a deep but not offensive malt taste. Smooth, not particularly fizzy.</li>
<li>Goedendag - slightly sharper taste of strong, pale alcohol - bit like Tripel Karmeliet but without such a nice rounded taste.</li>
<li>Duchesse de Bourgogne - "hints of balsamic vinegar" on the web - my bottle tasted entirely of balsamic vinegar. I hope this was a one-off - undrinkable.</li>
<li>Delirium Nocturnum - very dark, malty. Drinkable in isolation but probably couldn't manage more than one.</li>
<li>Philomene</li>
<li>kriek boon</li>
<li>quintine ... very nice, but fizzy</li>
<li>kastel donker 11 degrees... very dark, chocolatey beer. more than one is tough. very nice.</li>
<li>hertog jan karakter similar to kastel but fizzier and slightly more drinkable.</li>
<li>Duvel tripel hop citra. sadly quite disappointing. lemon overpowers any nice beer taste. don't bother.</li>
<li>Affligen dubbel, dark beer with strong caramel, very sweet, not too pleasant.</li>
<li>Affligen tripel however, blonder beer is very nice, refined with a kick. Up there with the Achel and Westmalle.</li>
<li>Brugse Tripel unremarkable dark beer with a bit of fizz. won't miss it.</li>
<li>Cornet Oaked (BE) indeed a bit of an oak taste makes it smooth and almost creme. lighter blond beer, nice aftertaste. not my favourite but worth enjoying.</li>
<li>La Trappe Isid'Or .. Darker, slightly maltier than Quad. I really like it. Got a strong kick.s</li>
<li>ter dolen donker ... lovely dark beer, caramel with a bit fruity</li>
<li>gulden draak ... very nice smooth dark beer. not much extra to it</li>
<li>Gentse Strop - quite a blond beer on appearance, but with a strong, quite brutal hoppy aftertaste. Not my favourite. Very fizzy.</li>
<li>petrus nitro quad ... bit sickly for me but otherwise a nice strong beer</li>
<li>Brouwerij Werbrouck (Dubbel) 8% ... fizzy, creamy and chocolately dark double beer. Forgettable.</li>
<li>Saint Lambertus (summer beer) - light, 5.5%. Bit of an unpleasant aftertaste consistent with beers of this type. Not great.</li>
<li>Pannepot vintage 2017 very dark strong stout beer with choc+creamy aftertaste. nice but not a personal fave</li>
<li>Grotte - Kazematten (Ieper) ... 6.5% dark beer with a slightly sour aftertaste. Cloudy in the bottle. Not fantastic.</li>
<li>Sant√© Grotten - actually rather nice. Dark beer with an unexpected fruity (almost sour) aftertaste.</li>
<li>Leffe Rituel 9 degrees - Stronger, slightly darker beer. Pleasant routine drink. Not outstanding.</li>
<li>Leffe Royale Blonde. Fizzy one, nothing exceptional but has an unusual honey aftertaste.</li>
<li>La Goudale (FR) A really nice, tasty beer ideal in 75cl bottles. Blonde and reasonably strong (7.2%)</li>
<li>Pelforth (FR): Very fizzy darker beer. Caramel taste hits upfront. Frankly tastes like table wine with a bit of a kick: artificially sweet. 6,5%</li>
<li>3 Monts (BE) From Flanders: A really nice 75cl bottle. Little bit fizzy, quite drinkable and blond .</li>
<li>Triple Secret Des Moins  light (in colour) blonde beer with a slight fermentation aftertaste. 8.0% ... Aroma is a little sour on first impression, but the taste takes hold pretty quickly. It's not a "bad" beer but I'm not fussed on finding it again.</li>
<li>De La Senne Stouterik Watery, with a strong fizzy and chocolate. I don't like this. It has no real body.</li>
<li>La Trappe Puur a weaker (4.7%) beer with a weird taste, almost hoppy in the way alcohol-free beers taste. Lingering sweet taste. Beer itself smells a little burnt. Taste is creamy and fizzy. Aftertaste lingers for a while. Nothing special but  a good option for "don't want to have too much".</li>
<li>Straffe Hendrik Quad ... very dark, malty but strangely sweet. Can't actually taste much booze despite being 11.5% I do like it.</li>
<li>Saison Dupont Quite a sour taste, particularly lingering. This is a reasonably nice beer, although going to be tough after the first bottle. Reasonably undistinct flavour otherwise. Not too creamy. Fizzy at times.</li>
