<h1>About these pages</h1>

<p><A href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic">Covid-19</a> has had widespread effects on society and economics. This is a small collection of resources looking at the effects of the pandemic, 
    likely eventual recovery plans (UK-based perspectives) and tracking updates.</p>

<p>These pages will be updated frequently. Please check back for more!</p>

<p>This is a personal project run by Sven Latham. I have interests in data in town centres, so these pages will have a particular bias.</p>

<p>Geeky bit: This is all on <a href="https://github.com/svenlatham/svenlatham-website">Github</a> if you want to see the source. I'm using it as an excuse to learn Jekyll as well ;-)</p>
